# Emotions-Classification-via-Speech-Audio
This repository provides PyTorch implementations of four distinct models for speech emotion classification:

1. Stacked Time-Distributed 2D CNN + LSTM

2. Stacked Time-Distributed 2D CNN + Bidirectional LSTM with Attention

3. Parallel 2D CNN + Bidirectional LSTM with Attention

4. Parallel 2D CNN + Transformer Encoder
